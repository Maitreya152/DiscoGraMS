DiscoGraMS: Enhancing Movie Screen-Play Summarization using Movie Character-Aware Discourse Graph

## Instructions for Running the Code  

1. **Set Hyperparameters:**  
   - Configure the appropriate hyperparameters in both `train.py` and `test.py` before execution.  

2. **Download and Prepare CaD Graphs:**  
   - Download the provided CaD graphs.  
   - Encode the text of each node using a sentence encoder of choice (or refer to the paper for our choice). This step is essential for `train.py` and `test.py` to function correctly.  

3. **Execute the Scripts:**  
   - Once the above steps are completed, proceed with running `train.py` and `test.py`.
